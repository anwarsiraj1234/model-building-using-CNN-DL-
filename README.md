What is CNN model architecture?
Introduction to Convolution Neural Network - GeeksforGeeks
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of Deep Learning neural network architecture commonly used in Computer Vision.
Computer vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables a computer to understand and interpret the image or visual data
1. What is Epoch?
Epoch is the total number of iterations of the training data in one cycle.

2. How do you use Epochs in Machine Learning?
Each epoch is used to update the internal model parameters a little. 

3. What is an Epoch in Tensorflow?
In Tensorflow, one epoch is one training iteration. All samples are iterated once in an iteration.

4. What is an Epoch in a neural network?
An epoch in a neural network is the training of the neural network with all the training data for one cycle. 

5. Who uses Epoch?
Machine learning specialists use epochs to train the machine learning model.

6. Why is Epoch important?
Each epoch contains weight update steps used to update the internal model parameters.
